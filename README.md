## Novelty
* Instead of using the Qi and Fossati's code generation method, I decided to use a lot of if statements, instead of changing a parse tree. I thought it would be easier to implement and also easier to read.
* The loop exercises that Qi and Fossati's code generates are different than mine which initalize a variable and mutate it and print at the end. Mine is more focused on indices.
* This is for JavaScript, while Qi and Fossati's is for Java.
* This is a web platform, while Qi and Fossati's is a Java application.
